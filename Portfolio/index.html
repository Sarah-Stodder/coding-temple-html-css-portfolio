                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>My name is Sarah, I am 22 years old.
                    I am a mother of two, and I am passionate about learning.
                    I met my husband in my freshman year of highschool, shortly after meeting we both started working, I was 14.
                    My first job was at a nursing home in florence colorado as an activities assistant, I really enjoyed working there but I was offered a postion at a restraunt that was just opening up.
                    I worked there for over a year and I had the title of head chef at 17. I was able to move out on my own while I worked there and my husband and I were married shortly after.
                    I started working at a diffrent nusring home, this time as a QMAP. I really loved working in health care but emotionally i wasnt cut out for the job.
                    A year after I started at the nursing home I left. I wasn't happy in my job and I just found out we were expecting. I was very ill during my pregancy, and I became a stay at home mom.

                <h1>Bringing change</h1>
                <p>3 years is a long time to be a stay at home mother and while I'm greatful for every moment I am a career woman. I rejoined the workforce with overwhelming enthusiasm.
                    I started working for the royal gorge route railroad as a sever and while it was very fun the pay wasnt stable and it just wasnt what I was looking for. I decided to look into UX design. I was intrested with the consepts and saw its usability in every day life so I decided to do some free courses on it. After two diffrent courses I kept having this nagging feeling, I was more intrested in how these apps and websites worked and less intrested in the full UX design process. So I started some free coding courses, I had  a lot of doubt in my ability to learn to code, I even joked with my husband saying I was too stupid to learn to code but it would be fun to try anyway. Much to my suprise I actually understood what I was trying to learn, I made my very own basic website and I was hooked.  </p>

                <p>I love my little town, I was born and raised right here in canon city colorado.
                    Canon city is home to the Royal Gorge Bridge, the tallest suspention bridge in the united states. 1,020 feet below the bridge is the river bed of the arkansas river, often you will see rafters conquering our class five rapids or our big horn sheep!
                    Canon city resides in fremont county, AKA death valley. Fremont county was dubbed "Death valley" due to having 14 prisons in county limits.
